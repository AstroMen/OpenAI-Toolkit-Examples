## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/OpenAI-Processing-Toolkit.git
cd OpenAI-Processing-Toolkit
```

Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

This toolkit contains several modules. Here's how to use them:

* `main.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. Run this script to start the program.

* `token_manager.py`: This module is responsible for managing tokens for text processing.

* `auto_finetune.py`: Use this module for automatic fine-tuning of the OpenAI models. After a successful fine-tuning, the status will be printed to the console, showing the fine-tuning process and the result. For example:

  ```bash
  openai api fine_tunes.follow -i  ft-na1mm1XJZYNfViXBk6QAeLtn
  [2023-07-31 13:33:19] Created fine-tune: ft-na1mm1XJZYNfViXBk6QAeLtn
  ...
  [2023-07-31 16:28:00] Fine-tune succeeded
  Job complete! Status: succeeded ðŸŽ‰
  Try out your fine-tuned model:
  openai api completions.create -m ada:ft-curajoy-2023-07-31-23-27-59 -p <YOUR_PROMPT>
  ```

* `chat_bot.py`: This module is a chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT models for generating responses.

* `openai_image_processor.py`: This module processes images using OpenAI's models.

* `openai_audio_processor.py`: This module processes audio using OpenAI's models.

* `prompt_preprocessor.py`: Use this module for preprocessing prompts for text generation.

* `openai_msg_handler.py`: This module handles messages in the context of an OpenAI chat.

* `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions and classes that support the other modules.

For detailed usage of each module, please refer to the comments and documentation in the respective Python files.
